The law is, therefore, clear that to justify the forfeiture of advance money being part of 'earnest money' the terms of the contract should be clear and explicit. Earnest money is paid or given at the time when the contract is entered into and, as a pledge for its due performance by the depositor to be forfeited in case of non-performance by the depositor. There can be converse situation also that if the seller fails to perform the contract the purchaser can also get double the amount, if it is so stipulated. It is also the law that part-payment of purchase price cannot be forfeited unless it is a guarantee for the due performance of the contract. In other words, if the payment is made only towards part-payment of consideration and not intended as earnest money then the forfeiture clause will not apply.' In sum and substance, the Apply.'          In sum and substance, the Appellants contend that forfeiture of sum is justified when it is - (a) clearly stipulated as earnest money; (b) forms part of sale consideration and (c) intended to be in the nature of 'guarantee for the due performance of the contract', and (d) the binding agreement between the parties provides its forfeiture in the event of breach of contract.",

If we were to hold that charge-sheets can be filed without completing the investigation, and the same can be used for prolonging remand, it would in effect negate the purpose of introducing section 167(2) of the CrPC and ensure that the fundamental rights guaranteed to accused persons is violated.           28.We have carefully perused the judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent, however, none of the judgments relied upon permit the abuse of remand under Section 309(2) of the CrPC by permitting the filing of incomplete charge-sheets only to scuttle the right of statutory bail.",
